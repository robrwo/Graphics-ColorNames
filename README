NAME
    Graphics::ColorNames - defines RGB values for common color names

REQUIREMENTS
    `Graphics::ColorNames' should work on Perl 5.6.0. It requires the
    following non-core (depending on your Perl version) modules:

      Module::Load
      Module::Loaded

    The following modules are not required for using most features but are
    recommended:

      Color::Library
      Tie::Sub

    Installation requires the following testing modules:

      Test::Exception
      Test::More

    If the `DEVEL_TESTS' environment variable is set, the tests will also
    use the following modules for running developer tests, if they are
    installed:

      Test::Pod
      Test::Pod::Coverage
      Test::Portability::Files

    The developer tests are for quality-control purposes.

INSTALLATION
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the newer
    Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use `nmake' instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build test
      perl Build install

SYNOPSIS
      use Graphics::ColorNames 2.10;

      $po = new Graphics::ColorNames(qw( X ));

      $rgb = $po->hex('green');          # returns '00ff00'
      $rgb = $po->hex('green', '0x');    # returns '0x00ff00'
      $rgb = $po->hex('green', '#');     # returns '#00ff00'

      $rgb = $po->rgb('green');          # returns '0,255,0'
      @rgb = $po->rgb('green');          # returns (0, 255, 0)  

      $rgb = $po->green;                 # same as $po->hex('green');

      tie %ph, 'Graphics::ColorNames', (qw( X ));

      $rgb = $ph{green};                 # same as $po->hex('green');

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a common interface for obtaining the RGB values of
    colors by standard names. The intention is to (1) provide a common
    module that authors can use with other modules to specify colors by
    name; and (2) free module authors from having to "re-invent the wheel"
    whenever they decide to give the users the option of specifying a color
    by name rather than RGB value.

    See the module POD for complete documentation.

REVISION HISTORY
    Changes since the last release:

    2.11    Thu Jan 10 2008
            - updated version number for release
            - minor changes of text format
            - added fix for problems with Graphics::ColorNames::GrayScale
    
    2.10_05 Tue Jan  8 2008
            * checks if modules already loaded before re-loading them
              (uses Module::Loaded for this)
            - requires changed to load for dynamically loaded modules
            - updated README
    
    2.10_04 Sun Jan  6 2008
            - reverted back to standard object-oriented style
            - Tie::Sub is only loaded when a subroutine is used for scheme
    
    2.10_03 Sat Jan  5 2008
            - tests use Test::Exception to catch errors
            - rewrite parts of documentation to emphasize object-oriented
              interface rather than the tied interface
            - implemented a proper DESTROY method
            - misc code cleanup and reorganization
    
    2.10_02 Fri Jan  4 2008
            * added support for Color::Library dictionaries
            - minor changes to error messages
            - underscores in color names ignored
            - auto-loading color names in object-oriented interface, e.g.
              $obj->black()
            - stubs for DESTROY and UNTIE methods
            - 06-obj.t test more flexible
            - pointless 01-ColourNames test removed
            - more updates to documentation
    
    2.10_01 Thu Dec 20 2007
            * non-word characters (spaces, punctuation) now ignored in
              color names
            * smarter handling of comments in rgb.txt files
            * significant rewrite to parts of the code, requires Tie::Sub
            * rewritten how FIRSTKEY and NEXTKEY methods work
            - better error handling
            - minor updates to documentation
            - typos in comments
            - added better checking for minimum Perl version reqs
            - added aliaes w/out punctuation in Netscape scheme
